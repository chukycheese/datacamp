This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Relational Operators

Equality: ==

```{r}
TRUE == TRUE

TRUE == FALSE

'hello' == 'goodbye'

3 == 2
```

Inequality !=

```{r}
'hello' != 'goodbye'
```
< and >

```{r}
3 < 5
3 > 5

# Character and Logical
'hello' > 'goodbye' # Alphabetical order!

TRUE < FALSE        # TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0 

```
<= and >=
```{r}
5 >= 3

3 >= 3
```

Relational Operators & Vectors
- Will be done in element-wise

```{r}
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
linkedin

linkedin > 10

facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
facebook

facebook <= linkedin
```


Practice

Equality
```{r}
# Logical
TRUE == FALSE

# Numeric
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Charactor strings
"useR" == "user"

# A logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
```
Greater and less than
```{r}
# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 5 + 2 >= -10 + 1

# Comparison of character strings
"raining" <= "raining dogs"

# Comparison of logicals
TRUE > FALSE
```
Compare vectors

```{r}
# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)

# Popular days
linkedin > 15

# Quiet days
linkedin <= 5

# LinkedIn more popular than Facebook
linkedin > facebook
```
Compare matrices

```{r}
# The social data has been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
views <- matrix(c(linkedin, facebook), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# When does views equal 13?
views == 13

# When is views less than or equal to 14?
views <= 14
```
Logical Operators

& and | (1)

```{r}
# The linkedin and last variable are already defined for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
last <- tail(linkedin, 1)

# Is last under 5 or above 10?
last < 5 | last > 10

# Is last between 15 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)?
last > 15 & last < 20
```

& and | (2)

```{r}
# The social data (linkedin, facebook, views) has been created for you

# linkedin exceeds 10 but facebook below 10
linkedin > 10 & facebook < 10

# When were one or both visited at least 12 times?
linkedin >= 12 | facebook >= 12

# When is views between 11 (exclusive) and 14 (inclusive)?
views > 11 & views <= 14
```

Blend it all together

```{r}
# li_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select the second column, named day2, from li_df: second
second <- li_df['day2']

# Build a logical vector, TRUE if value in second is extreme: extremes
extremes <- second > 25 | second < 5

# Count the number of TRUEs in extremes
sum(extremes)

# Solve it with a one-liner
sum(li_df['day2'] > 25 | li_df['day2'] < 5)
```


Conditional Statements

if statement

```{r}
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium <- "LinkedIn"
num_views <- 14

# Examine the if statement for medium
if (medium == "LinkedIn") {
  print("Showing LinkedIn information")
}

# Write the if statement for num_views
if (num_views > 15) {
  print("You're popular!")
}


```

Add an else

```{r}
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium <- "LinkedIn"
num_views <- 14

# Control structure for medium
if (medium == "LinkedIn") {
  print("Showing LinkedIn information")
} else {
  print("Unknown medium")
}



# Control structure for num_views
if (num_views > 15) {
  print("You're popular!")
} else {
  print("Try to be more visible!")
}
```

Customize further: else if

```{r}
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium <- "LinkedIn"
num_views <- 14

# Control structure for medium
if (medium == "LinkedIn") {
  print("Showing LinkedIn information")
} else if (medium == "Facebook") {
  # Add code to print correct string when condition is TRUE
  print("Showing Facebook information")
} else {
  print("Unknown medium")
}

# Control structure for num_views
if (num_views > 15) {
  print("You're popular!")
} else if (num_views <= 15 & num_views > 10) {
  # Add code to print correct string when condition is TRUE
  print("Your number of views is average")
} else {
  print("Try to be more visible!")
}
```

Take control!

    Finish the control-flow construct with the following behavior:

    If both li and fb are 15 or higher, set sms equal to double the sum of li and fb.
    If both li and fb are strictly below 10, set sms equal to half the sum of li and fb.
    In all other cases, set sms equal to li + fb.
    Finally, print the resulting sms variable to the console.

```{r}
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
li <- 15
fb <- 9

# Code the control-flow construct
if (li >= 15 & fb >= 15) {
  sms <- 2 * (li + fb)
} else if (li < 10 & fb < 10) {
  sms <- 0.5 * (li + fb)
} else {
  sms <- li + fb
}

# Print the resulting sms to the console
print(sms)
```





When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
