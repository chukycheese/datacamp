This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## Titanic

```{r}
# Import titanic from csv
titanic <- read.csv("titanic.csv")

# Call dim on titanic
dim(titanic)

# Generate histogram of Age column
hist(titanic$Age)
```

## Exploratory queries
* abs(): calculate the absolute value.
* sum(): calculate the sum of all the values in a data structure.
* mean(): calculate the arithmetic mean.
* round(): Round the values to 0 decimal places by default. Try out ?round in the console for variations of round() and ways to change the number of digits to round to.

```{r}
# titanic is available in your workspace

# Print out total value of fares
sum(titanic$Fare)

# Print out proportion of passengers that survived
sum(titanic$Survived) / nrow(titanic)
```

## Infer gender from name (1)

```{r}
# Extract the name column from titanic
pass_names <- titanic$Name

# Create the logical vectror is_man
is_man <- grepl(pattern = ", Mr\\.", pass_names)

# Count the number of men
sum(is_man)

# Count number of men based on gender
sum(titanic$Sex == "male")
```

## Infer gender from name (2)

```{r}
# Extract the name column from titanic
pass_names <- titanic$Name

# Create titles
titles <- gsub(pattern = "^.*, (.*?)\\..*$", "\\1", pass_names)

# Call unique() on titles
unique(titles)
```

## Infer gender from name (3)

```{r}
pass_names <- titanic$Name
titles <- paste(",", c("Mr\\.", "Master", "Don", "Rev", "Dr\\.", "Major", "Sir", "Col", "Capt", "Jonkheer"))

# Finish the vapply() command
hits <- vapply(titles,
               FUN = grepl,
               FUN.VALUE = logical(length(pass_names)),
               x = pass_names)

# Calculate the sum() of hits
sum(hits)

# Count number of men based on gender
sum(titanic$Sex == "male")
```

## Reformat passenger names

```{r}
# pass_names is available in your workspace

convert_name <- function(name) {
  # women: take name from inside parentheses
  if (grepl("\\(.*?\\)", name)) {
    gsub("^.*?\\((.*?)\\)$", "\\1", name)
  # men: take name before comma and after title
  } else {
    # Finish the gsub() function
    gsub("^(.*?),\\s[a-zA-Z\\.]*?\\s(.*?)$", "\\2 \\1", name)
  }
}

# Call convert_name on name
clean_pass_names <- vapply(pass_names, FUN = convert_name,
                           FUN.VALUE = character(1),
                           USE.NAMES = FALSE)

# Print out clean_pass_names
clean_pass_names
```

## Add birth dates

```{r}
# titanic, dob1 and dob2 are preloaded

# Have a look at head() of dob1 and dob2
head(dob1)
head(dob2)

# Convert dob1 to dob1d, convert dob2 to dob2d
dob1d <- as.Date(dob1)
dob2d <- as.Date(dob2, format = "%B %d, %Y")

# Combine dob1d and dob2d into single vector: birth_dates
birth_dates <- c(dob1d, dob2d)
```

## Average age

```{r}
# titanic, dob1 and dob2 are preloaded
dob1d <- as.Date(dob1)
dob2d <- as.Date(dob2, format = "%B %d, %Y")
birth_dates <- c(dob1d, dob2d)
disaster_date <- as.Date("1912-04-15")

# Add birth_dates to titanic (column Birth)
titanic$Birth <- birth_dates

# Create subset: survivors
survivors <- subset(titanic, Survived == 1)

# Calculate average age of survivors
mean(disaster_date - survivors$Birth, na.rm = TRUE)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
