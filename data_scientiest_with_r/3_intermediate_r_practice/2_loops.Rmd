This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## Scanning Logs in R

```{r}
# Will not run

# logs is already available in your workspace

# Print the structure of logs
str(logs)

# Use list subsetting to print the details part of 11th logs entry
logs[[11]]

# Print the class of the timestamp component of the first entry
class(logs[[1]]$timestamp)
```

## While: start easy

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Initialize the iterator i to be 1
i <- 1

# Code the while loop
while ( logs[[i]]$success == TRUE ) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
  
}
```

## Adapt the while loop

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Adapt the while loop
i <- 1
while (logs[[i]]$success) {
  print(logs[[i]]$details$message)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

## While: different approach

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Initialize i and found
i <- 1
found <- FALSE

# Code the while loop
while (found == FALSE) {
  if (logs[[i]]$success == FALSE && logs[[i]]$detail$location == "waste") {
    print("found")
    found <- TRUE
  } else {
    print("still looking")
    i <- i + 1
  }
}
```

## The for loop

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Code a for loop that prints the timestamp of each log
for (log in logs) {
  print(log$timestamp)
}
```

## Going through the list

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Make the printout conditional: only if success
for (log in logs) {
  if (log$success){
  print(log$timestamp)
  }
}
```

## Adapt the logs list

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Finish the for loop: add date element for each entry
for (i in 1:length(logs)) {
  logs[[i]]$date <- as.Date(logs[[i]]$timestamp)
}

# Print first 6 elements in logs
head(logs)
```

## Collect all failures

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Intialize empty list: failures
failures <- list()

# Finish the for loop: add each failure to failures
for (log in logs) {
  if (log$success == FALSE) {
    failures <- c(failures, list(log))
  }
}

# Display the structure of failures
str(failures)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
