This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## Using functions

```{r}
timestamps <- as.Date(c("2015-09-15 08:00:53 UTC", "2015-09-15 18:07:58 UTC",
                         "2015-09-15 21:14:16 UTC", "2015-09-17 01:31:51 UTC",
                         "2015-09-17 13:33:43 UTC", "2015-09-17 15:34:22 UTC",
                         "2015-09-18 03:37:18 UTC"))

# logs is available in your workspace

# Call max() on timestamps
max(timestamps)

# What is the date of the latest timestamp?
max(as.Date(timestamps))
```

## Optional Arguments

```{r}
timestamps <- c("2015-09-15 08:00:53 UTC", "2015-09-15 18:07:58 UTC",
                         "2015-09-15 21:14:16 UTC", "2015-09-17 01:31:51 UTC",
                         NA, "2015-09-17 15:34:22 UTC",
                         "2015-09-18 03:37:18 UTC")

# A faulty version of timestamps is available in your workspace

# Print out timestamps
timestamps

# Call max() on timestamps, no additional arguments
max(timestamps)

# Call max() on timestamps, specify na.rm
max(timestamps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Extract log information (1)

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# for loop to extract timestamp; put this inside function body below
info <- c()
for (log in logs) {
 info <- c(info, log$timestamp)
}

# Build a function extract_info(): use for loop, add return statement
extract_info <- function(x) {
  # body
  info <- c()
  for (element in x){
    info <- c(info, element$timestamp)
  }
  return (info)
}

# Call extract_info() on logs
extract_info(logs)
```

## Extract log information (2)

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Adapt the extract_info() function.
extract_info <- function(x, property) {
  info <- c()
  for (log in x) {
   info <- c(info, log[[property]])
  }
  return(info)
}

# Call extract_info() on logs, set property to "timestamp"
extract_info(logs, "timestamp")

# Call extract_info() on logs, set property to "success"
extract_info(logs, "success")
```

## Extract log information (3)

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Add default value for property argument
extract_info <- function(x, property = "success") {
  info <- c()
  for (log in x) {
   info <- c(info, log[[property]])
  }
  return(info)
}

# Call extract_info() on logs, don't specify property
extract_info(logs)

# Call extract_info() on logs, set property to "timestamp"
extract_info(logs, "timestamp")
```

## Extract log information (4)

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Adapt extract_info():
# - add argument with default value
# - change function body
extract_info <- function(x, property = "success", include_all = TRUE) {
  info <- c()
  for (log in x) {

   # add if construct around the line below
   if(include_all || !log$success){
     info <- c(info, log[[property]])  
   }
  
  }
  return(info)
}

# Call extract_info() on logs, no additional arguments
extract_info(logs)

# Call extract_info() on logs, set include_all to FALSE
extract_info(logs, include_all = FALSE)
```

## Extract log information (5)

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Defition of the extract_info() function
extract_info <- function(x, property = "success", include_all = TRUE) {
  info <- c()
  for (log in x) {
    if (include_all || !log$success) {
     info <- c(info, log[[property]])
    }
  }
  return(info)
}

# Generate vector of messages
extract_info(logs, property = c("details", "message"))

# Generate vector of locations for failed log entries
extract_info(logs, property = c("details", "location"), include_all = FALSE)
```

## Over to you

```{r}
# logs is available in your workspace

# Write the function compute_fail_pct
compute_fail_pct <- function(list){
  total <- length(list)
  failure <- 0
  for (item in list){
    if (item$success == FALSE){
      failure <- failure + 1
    }
  }
  return (failure / total * 100)
}


# Call compute_fail_pct on logs
compute_fail_pct(logs)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
