# readxl package

## List the shees of an Excel file

```{r}
# install.packages("readxl")

# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Print out the names of both spreadsheets
excel_sheets("urbanpop.xlsx")
```

## Import an Excel sheet

```{r}
# The readxl package is already loaded

# Read the sheets, one by one
pop_1 <- read_excel("urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 1)
pop_2 <- read_excel("urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 2)
pop_3 <- read_excel("urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 3)

# Put pop_1, pop_2 and pop_3 in a list: pop_list
pop_list <- list(pop_1, pop_2, pop_3)

# Display the structure of pop_list
str(pop_list)
```

## Reading a workbook

```{r}
# The readxl package is already loaded

# Read all Excel sheets with lapply(): pop_list
pop_list <- lapply(excel_sheets("urbanpop.xlsx"),
                   read_excel,
                   path = "urbanpop.xlsx")

# Display the structure of pop_list
str(pop_list)
```

## The col_names argument

```{r}
# The readxl package is already loaded

# Import the the first Excel sheet of urbanpop_nonames.xlsx (R gives names): pop_a
pop_a <- read_excel("urbanpop_nonames.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = FALSE)

# Import the the first Excel sheet of urbanpop_nonames.xlsx (specify col_names): pop_b
cols <- c("country", paste0("year_", 1960:1966))
pop_b <- read_excel("urbanpop_nonames.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = cols)

# Print the summary of pop_a
summary(pop_a)

# Print the summary of pop_b
summary(pop_b)
```

## The skip argument

```{r}
# The readxl package is already loaded

# Import the second sheet of urbanpop.xlsx, skipping the first 21 rows: urbanpop_sel
urbanpop_sel <- read_excel("urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 2, skip = 21, col_names = FALSE)

# Print out the first observation from urbanpop_sel
urbanpop_sel[1, ]
```

# gdata package
Perl needs to be installed.
## Import a local file

```{r}
# install.packages("gdata")

# Load the gdata package
library(gdata)

# Import the second sheet of urbanpop.xls: urban_pop
urban_pop <- read.xls("urbanpop.xls", sheet = 2)

# Print the first 11 observations using head()
head(urban_pop, 11)
```

## read.xls() wraps around read.table()

```{r}
# The gdata package is alreaded loaded

# Column names for urban_pop
columns <- c("country", paste0("year_", 1967:1974))

# Finish the read.xls call
urban_pop <- read.xls("urbanpop.xls", sheet = 2,
                      skip = 50, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      col.names = columns)

# Print first 10 observation of urban_pop
head(urban_pop, 10)
```

## Work that Excel data!

```{r}
# Add code to import data from all three sheets in urbanpop.xls
path <- "urbanpop.xls"
urban_sheet1 <- read.xls(path, sheet = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
urban_sheet2 <- read.xls(path, sheet = 2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
urban_sheet3 <- read.xls(path, sheet = 3, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Extend the cbind() call to include urban_sheet3: urban
urban <- cbind(urban_sheet1, urban_sheet2[-1], urban_sheet3[-1])

# Remove all rows with NAs from urban: urban_clean
urban_clean <- na.omit(urban)

# Print out a summary of urban_clean
summary(urban_clean)
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
