This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## 

```{r}
# install.packages("readr")

# Load the readr package
library(readr)

# Import potatoes.csv with read_csv(): potatoes
potatoes <- read_csv("potatoes.csv")

```

## read_tsv

```{r}
# readr is already loaded

# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import potatoes.txt: potatoes
potatoes <- read_tsv("potatoes.txt", col_names = properties)

# Call head() on potatoes
head(potatoes)
```

## read_delim

```{r}
# readr is already loaded

# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import potatoes.txt using read_delim(): potatoes
potatoes <- read_delim("potatoes.txt", delim = "\t", col_names = properties)

# Print out potatoes
potatoes
```

## skip and n_max

```{r}
# readr is already loaded

# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import 5 observations from potatoes.txt: potatoes_fragment
potatoes_fragment <- read_tsv("potatoes.txt", skip = 6, n_max = 5, col_names = properties)
```

## col_types

```{r}
# readr is already loaded

# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import all data, but force all columns to be character: potatoes_char
potatoes_char <- read_tsv("potatoes.txt", col_types = "cccccccc", col_names = properties)

# Print out structure of potatoes_char
str(potatoes_char)
```

## col_types with collectors

```{r}
# readr is already loaded

# Import without col_types
hotdogs <- read_tsv("hotdogs.txt", col_names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Display the summary of hotdogs
summary(hotdogs)

# The collectors you will need to import the data
fac <- col_factor(levels = c("Beef", "Meat", "Poultry"))
int <- col_integer()

# Edit the col_types argument to import the data correctly: hotdogs_factor
hotdogs_factor <- read_tsv("hotdogs.txt",
                           col_names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"),
                           col_types = list(fac, int, int))

# Display the summary of hotdogs_factor
summary(hotdogs_factor)
```

## fread

```{r}
# load the data.table package
library(data.table)

# Import potatoes.csv with fread(): potatoes
potatoes <- fread("potatoes.csv")

# Print out potatoes
print(potatoes)
```

## fread : more advanced use

```{r}
# fread is already loaded

# Import columns 6 and 8 of potatoes.csv: potatoes
potatoes <- fread("potatoes.csv", select = c(6, 8))

# Plot texture (x) and moistness (y) of potatoes
plot(x = potatoes$texture, y = potatoes$moistness)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
