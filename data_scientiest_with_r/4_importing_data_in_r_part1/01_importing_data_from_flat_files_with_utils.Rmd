This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## read.csv

```{r}
# Import swimming_pools.csv: pools
pools <- read.csv("swimming_pools.csv")

# Print the structure of pools
str(pools)
```

## stringsAsFactors

```{r}
# Import swimming_pools.csv correctly: pools
pools <- read.csv("swimming_pools.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Check the structure of pools
str(pools)
```

## read.delim

```{r}
# Import hotdogs.txt: hotdogs
hotdogs <- read.delim("hotdogs.txt", header = FALSE)

# Summarize hotdogs
summary(hotdogs)
```

## read.table

```{r}
# Path to the hotdogs.txt file: path
path <- file.path("hotdogs.txt")

# Import the hotdogs.txt file: hotdogs
hotdogs <- read.table(path, 
                      sep = "\t", 
                      col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Call head() on hotdogs
head(hotdogs)
```

## Arguments

```{r}
# Finish the read.delim() call
hotdogs <- read.delim("hotdogs.txt", header = FALSE, col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Select the hot dog with the least calories: lily
lily <- hotdogs[which.min(hotdogs$calories), ]

# Select the observation with the most sodium: tom
tom <- hotdogs[which.max(hotdogs$sodium), ]

# Print lily and tom
lily
tom

```

## Column classes

```{r}
# Previous call to import hotdogs.txt
hotdogs <- read.delim("hotdogs.txt", header = FALSE, col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Display structure of hotdogs
str(hotdogs)

# Edit the colClasses argument to import the data correctly: hotdogs2
hotdogs2 <- read.delim("hotdogs.txt", header = FALSE, 
                       col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"),
                       colClasses = c("factor", "NULL", "numeric"))


# Display structure of hotdogs2
str(hotdogs2)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
