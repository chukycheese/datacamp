# XLConnect package

## Connect to a workbook

```{r}
# urbanpop.xlsx is available in your working directory

# Load the XLConnect package
library(XLConnect)

# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx: my_book
my_book <- loadWorkbook("urbanpop.xlsx")

# Print out the class of my_book
class(my_book)
```

## List and read Excel sheets

```{r}
# XLConnect is already available

# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("urbanpop.xlsx")

# List the sheets in my_book
getSheets(my_book)

# Import the second sheet in my_book
readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = 2)
```

## Customize readWorksheet

```{r}
# XLConnect is already available

# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("urbanpop.xlsx")

# Import columns 3, 4, and 5 from second sheet in my_book: urbanpop_sel
urbanpop_sel <- readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = 2, startCol = 3, endCol = 5)

# Import first column from second sheet in my_book: countries
countries <- readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = 2, keep = 1)

# cbind() urbanpop_sel and countries together: selection
selection <- cbind(countries, urbanpop_sel)
```

## Add worksheet

```{r}
# XLConnect is already available

# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("urbanpop.xlsx")

# Add a worksheet to my_book, named "data_summary"
createSheet(my_book, "data_summary")

# Use getSheets() on my_book
getSheets(my_book)
```

## Populate worksheet

```{r}
# XLConnect is already available

# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("urbanpop.xlsx")

# Add a worksheet to my_book, named "data_summary"
createSheet(my_book, "data_summary")

# Create data frame: summ
sheets <- getSheets(my_book)[1:3]
dims <- sapply(sheets, function(x) dim(readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = x)), USE.NAMES = FALSE)
summ <- data.frame(sheets = sheets,
                   nrows = dims[1, ],
                   ncols = dims[2, ])

# Add data in summ to "data_summary" sheet
writeWorksheet(object = my_book, data = summ, sheet = "data_summary")

# Save workbook as summary.xlsx
saveWorkbook(object = my_book, file = "summary.xlsx")
```

## Renaming sheets

```{r}
# my_book is available

# Rename "data_summary" sheet to "summary"
renameSheet(object = my_book, sheet = "data_summary", newName = "summary")

# Print out sheets of my_book
getSheets(my_book)

# Save workbook to "renamed.xlsx"
saveWorkbook(object = my_book, file = "renamed.xlsx")
```

## Removing sheet

```{r}
# Load the XLConnect package
library(XLConnect)

# Build connection to renamed.xlsx: my_book
my_book <- loadWorkbook("renamed.xlsx")

# Remove the fourth sheet
removeSheet(object = my_book, sheet = 4)

# Save workbook to "clean.xlsx"
saveWorkbook(object = my_book, file = "clean.xlsx")
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
